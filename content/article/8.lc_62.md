## Question

一个机器人位于一个 m x n 网格的左上角 （起始点在下图中标记为 “Start” ）。

机器人每次只能向下或者向右移动一步。机器人试图达到网格的右下角（在下图中标记为 “Finish” ）。

问总共有多少条不同的路径？

```
输入：m = 3, n = 2
输出：3

-> m
[0][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][x]
```

## Solution

### a. DFS

My first thought was using `DFS` to solve this problem. 
- Every step has two directions: `x` or `y`.
- To reach the destination, the robot's `x` should be less than `m` and `y` should be less than `n`.
- When `x` is equal to `m` and `y` is equal to `n`, the robot reaches the destination.

Here is the code:

```python
def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    x, y = 1, 1
    ans = [0]

    def dfs(x, y, m, n):
        if x == m and y == n:
            ans[0] += 1
            return 0
        if x < m:
            dfs(x+1, y, m, n)
        if y < n:
            dfs(x, y+1, m, n)
    dfs(x, y, m, n)
    return ans[0]
```

Not surprisingly, this method will time out. 
We need another algorithm to scale down the Time complexity.

### b. DP (Dynamic Programming)

DP is *Divide-and-Conque (D&C)* with *Memorization*

Take a closer look to is problem, I found that *divide-and-conque (D&C)* algorithm is really suitable.
The problem `f(m, n)` could be divided into two parts: `f(m, n-1)` and `f(m-1, n)`

Additional, there is only `1` way if `m` is equal to 1 or `n` is equal to 1.

So we have the following ***Recurrence***:


<p class="text-center code-family">f(m,n) = 1, if m = 1 or n = 1</p>
<p class="text-center code-family">f(m,n) = f(m-1, n) + f(m, n-1)</p>


Implementing the algorithm with python3.

```python
def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    dp = [[1]*n] + [[1]+[0]*(n-1) for _ in range(m-1)]  # init lookup table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

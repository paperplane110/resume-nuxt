## Process

### pkill

To kill a process by its name

```shell
pkill python2
```

### pgrep

Get the pid like using `grep`

```shell
pgrep python2

>>> 11123
```

By process name and its parameters, we use `-f`, which means 'full'

```shell
pgrep -f "python2 test.py*"
```

Use `pgrep` with `kill`

```shell
kill -9 $(pgrep -f "python2 test.py*")
```

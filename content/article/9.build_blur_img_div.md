### Before we start...

When building this website, I found that the page of `articles` always leaves a lot of 
blank space while loading those image covers. 
It's very boring and crude to leave those spaces,
so I was thinking about adding some _interesting_ effects while waiting for the loading.

I came up with the <b>blur effect</b> immediately, 
cause I have seen a similar effect in `Nextjs <Image>`.
So, I decided to apply the same effect to my article's covers.
After hours of searching and coding, I finally achieved this effect.

Briefly, there will be two layers:

1. The blur image layer, which could be loaded immediately
2. The image layer, which might take some time to download

The blur layer's opacity is 100 while downloading the image, 
As long as the image is completely downloaded, 
the blur layer's opacity will transit to 0 and reveal the image. 
**You could hover over the picture belowðŸ‘‡, it shows what I mean**

Now, let's build this `<ImageBg>` with blur effect step by step!

::tip{type="tip" title="Pre-requisite"}

- Know the base knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, and Vue3
- Have a playground where you can build the Vue component (like [Codepen](https://codepen.io/))
- Better have a look at this [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/), where we would generate the 'magic code' of blur images
  
::

### 1. A div with the image background

At the first, create a new component called `ImageBg.vue`. 
It will contain a blur layer and an image layer. 

Then let's build a `div` with a simple image background in `ImageBg.vue`.

```vue [ImageBg.vue]
<template>
  <div class="container">
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-image: url(/img/article_cover/blur_cover.jpg);
}
</style>
```
Now, you will have a div, whose width is 300px and height is 200px, with an image background.

<BlurTutorialStep1></BlurTutorialStep1>

But there is a little bug, the image is not fully displayed.
It keeps the original size and only shows its left top corner.
Let's fix this by adding some background image settings.

### 2. Center and resize the background image

```vue [ImageBg.vue] {9,10} 
<template>
  ...
</template>

<style scoped>
.container {
  ...
  background-image: url(/img/article_cover/blur_cover.jpg);
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
}
</style>
```

Add some settings in `CSS`, and we could see the image is displayed properly.

<BlurTutorialStep2></BlurTutorialStep2>

::tip{type="tip"}
- background-position: means the relative position between the background image and div. 
  We pass 'center' to it means that the image would be placed at the center of the div.
- background-size: 'cover' means the image will try to fill the whole div and keep its aspect ratio.
  The image won't be deformed.
::

Now, the image layer is fully prepared. 
In the next step, we will learn how to generate a blurred image and make it a component.

### 3. Blur an image with [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/)

Blurhash provides an algorithm to convert an image to a <Sparkle>Blurhash string</Sparkle>, 
which presents a blurred image and can be parsed by `<canvas>`.

The process of an image transfer to a string is called 'encode',
and the process of a string converting to an image is called 'decode'.
Now, please upload one image you like and keep the <Sparkle>Blurhash string</Sparkle>.
For me, it is:

- `LIA_9M%3L~-.yYRO8{OGuPX8ITo#`

Woltapp, the creator of the Blurhash, has provided the SDK in many languages, 
with those tools, you could automate the 'encode' process easily. 
But in this tutorial, we would just simply drag the image to its website,
and get the Blurhash string.

To decode this string we need to use Blurhash's SDK in JS language. Let's install it.

```bash
# use npm
npm install blurhash

# or use yarn
yarn add blurhash
```

### 4. Build the skeleton of `<ImageBlur>`

Firstly, we will create a new component called `<ImageBlur>` only has the skeleton.

```vue [ImageBlur.vue]
<template>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <canvas class="canvas" width=32 height=32 />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang='ts'>
</script>

<style scoped>
.wrapper {
  position: relative;
  height: 0;
}

.canvas {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 10;
}
</style>
```

Here are only HTML and CSS, and it ***won't display anything***, so don't be worried. 
Let's break it down little by little.

In `<template>`, there are two elements nested. 
The outer is `wrapper`, it is a `div` without any height
because we will use `padding-bottom` to control its verticle space occupation in the next step.
Also `position: relative` tells the child element that 
their position should be relative to the left-top corner of the `wrapper`. 
Here is a useful link that tells how the `position` works: [mdn-css-postion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)

The child element, `canvas`, is where we draw the pixels.
Its CSS attribute, `position: absolute`, tells that it will be placed according to its parent element,
which has the `position: relative` attribute, in our case, it would be `wrapper`. 
The following `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` tells 
the canvas would be fixed at the left-top corner of the wrapper.

Finally, to make the canvas a cover, we use `z-index` to set it at the front.

### 5. Finish `<ImageBlur>` component

In this step, we will define the properties of the component,
so that we don't need to hardcode any Blurhash string in our component.
Also, we will learn how to decode a Blurhash string and draw it on the canvas.
Here is the code.

```vue [ImageBlur.vue] {2,3,8-35}
<template>
  <div class="wrapper" :style="`padding-bottom: ${props.aspectRatio}%`">
    <canvas class="canvas" ref="canvas" width=32 height=32 />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang='ts'>
  import { decode } from "blurhash"

  // Define the props of this component
  // hash: the blurhash string from Blurhash, with default value "LVKmwwp{krRj8_xsg4Six]xtWCt6"
  // aspectRatio: height/width * 100
  const props = defineProps({
    hash: { type: String, default: "LIA_9M%3L~-.yYRO8{OGuPX8ITo#" },
    aspectRatio: { type: Number, default: 56.25 },
  })

  // use ref to get the canvase element
  const canvas = ref<HTMLCanvasElement | null>(null)
  const pixels = decode(props.hash, 32, 32)

  onMounted(() => {
    if (!canvas.value) {
      // ensure to get the ref of the canvase element
      console.log("Canvase is not ready")
      return;
    }
    const ctx = canvas.value.getContext("2d")
    if (ctx) {
      // ensure ctx is not null
      const imageData = ctx.createImageData(32, 32)
      imageData.data.set(pixels)
      ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0)
    }
  })
</script>

<style scoped>
  /* ... */
</style>
```

Let's have a look at the script part.
We import the `decode` function for decoding the hash to pixels.
Then we define two props `hash` and `aspectRatio`. The details are written in the comment.

We use `ref` to get the DOM element in HTML, just like `getElementById()` in Vanilla JS.

After that, we use the decode function and store the pixel information in `pixels`.
As long as the component is mounted, we draw the pixel on the canvas.

::tip{type="tip" title="Note that the variable's name should be the same as the ref's name in HTML"}

::

Place it in a div and we got this.

```vue
<template>
  <div style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
    <ImageBlur>
  </div>
</template>
```

### 6. Composition

Now, let's put everything together!

```vue [ImageBg.vue]
<template>
  <div ref="wrapper" class="container">
    <ImageBlur class="blur" :hash="props.hash" :style="{ opacity: onLoaded ? 0 : 100 }" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang='ts'>

const props = defineProps<{
  src: string
  hash: string
}>()

const wrapper = ref(null)
const onLoaded = ref(false)

onMounted(() => {
  // Load the bg-image as Image firstly
  const bgImage = new Image()
  bgImage.src = props.src

  // when image full loaded, pass it to bg-image
  bgImage.onload = () => {
    wrapper.value.style.backgroundImage = `url(${props.src})`
    onLoaded.value = true
  }
})
</script>

<style scoped>
.container {
  /** ... */
}

.blur {
  min-width: 100%;
  min-height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  transition: opacity 500ms;
}
</style>
```

To control the opacity of the blur layer, we define a variable, `onLoaded`, with an initialized value of `false`,
which means the image is **not loaded** at the beginning.

After the image is loaded, it will change to `true`, 
as we defined this action in `bgImage.onload()` callback function.

In the style definition of `<ImageBlur>`, we use the [Conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)
to manipulate the opacity.

Furthermore, we could define the opacity transition in 500ms, to have a smooth transition from blur to clear.

Finally, you have your ImageBg with blur effect. Voila ðŸŽ‰

### Thanks for reading!

::tip{type="tip" title="Bonus"}
If you want the round corner like the image above, 
try to add `border-radius` and `overflow` to the container's CSS

```vue [ImageBg.vue] {10,11}
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>

<script setup lang='ts'>...</script>

<style scoped>
.container {
  /* ... */
  border-radius: 2rem;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.blur {
  /* ... */
}
</style>
```

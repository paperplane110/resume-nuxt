## 0. Before we start...

When building this website, I found that the page of `articles` always leaves a lot of 
blank space while loading those image covers. 
It's very boring and crude to leave those spaces,
so I was thinking about adding some _interesting_ effects while waiting for the loading.

I came up with the <b>blur effect</b> immediately, 
cause I have seen a similar effect in `Nextjs <Image>`.
So, I decided to apply the same effect to my article's covers.
After hours of searching and coding, I finally achieved this effect.
Now, let's build this `<ImageBg>` with blur effect step by step!

- Know the base knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, and Vue3
- Have a playground where you can build the Vue component (like [Codepen](https://codepen.io/))
- Better have a look at this [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/), where we would generate the 'magic code' of blur images

## 1. Build an image covered `<div>`

At the first, let's build a `div` with a simple image background in `ImageBg.vue`.

```js [ImageBg.vue]
<template>
</template>

```
